# KAKFA
Data is continously generated through various resources. A streaming platform such as Netflix, Linkedin, Yahoo, Twitter uses Kafka to process the data. Kafka major task is to post and subscribe to data streams.  Kafka stores the stream of records in the order which they are generated. 

Kafka is used to not only build streaming data pipelines but also to build real time streaming applications. 

Streaming data pipelines move data from multiple sources to multiple target destinations in real time, capturing events as they are created and making them available for transformation, enrichment, and analysis. For many applications, real-time and continuously fresh data is vital. Examples include:
Mobile banking apps

Data Producers [IoT Sensors, Web/Mobile, SaaS Apps] -> Message Brokers -> Data Consumers [Databases, AI/ML Tools]

A data pipeline reliably processes and moves data from one system to another, and a streaming application is an application that consumes streams of data

**Kafka combines messaging queue and publish subscribe approaches.**
